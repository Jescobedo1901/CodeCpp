Coding activities done in C++

Section one ----- Data Mining Class

  Lab 1 - 
    Determining break points in continuous variables (changing continuous into discrete)
    by calculating Entropy at each step and finding the most information gained.
    
  Lab 2 - 
    Using the K-NN model to classify a testing set based off a training set. Supervised learning.
    Program determines the best K value from the training set, then uses that K value on the Unknown set.
    
  Lab 3 - 
    Clustering using the K-Means method, example assumes that K is 2. Methodologies to determine K to come next.
  
  Lab 4 - 
    Clustering with Hierarchy, 4 different proximity methods: Centroid, Max, Min, and Mean (avg).
  
  Lab 5 - Hidden Markov Model (Coming soon)
  
  
Section two ----- Cracking the Coding Interview Book Examples

  Each chapter will have it's own section as they're completed.
